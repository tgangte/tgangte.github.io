title: Handy SRE Tools

 [SRE Swiss army knife - Hostname Extractor and Formatter](/hostname) - I wrote this tool to address my specific needs of parsing hostnames in bulk. I've published it here in case others find it handy!
 
 [SRE Swiss army knife - XML to Table converter](/xml-to-table) -  I deal with JSON, YAML, CSV, XML files on a daily basis, but I often find XML to be so cluttered and too verbose with all the tags that it can become difficult to read. This tool prettifies any valid XML file and prints it into a HTML table.
